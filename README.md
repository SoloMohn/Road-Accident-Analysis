## Project Overview
This project looks into how and why road accidents happen. We collected and studied data to find patterns in accident locations, times, and causes. The goal is to better understand what leads to road accidents so that steps can be taken to prevent them. The analysis highlights key risk factors and areas where safety improvements can be made. This report provides useful findings that can help decision-makers, city planners, and road users create safer roads for everyone.
