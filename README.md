## Project Overview
This project looks into how and why road accidents happen. We collected and studied data to find patterns in accident locations, times, and causes. The goal is to better understand what leads to road accidents so that steps can be taken to prevent them. The analysis highlights key risk factors and areas where safety improvements can be made. This report provides useful findings that can help decision-makers, city planners, and road users create safer roads for everyone.

## Tools Used
- Excel (Data cleaning, Pivot tables, Data visualization).
  
## Key Findings

### 1. Total Casualities - 417,883
- 2021: 222,146
- 2022: 195,737 (slight drop in 2022)

#### 2. Severity:
- Fatal: 7,135
- Serious: 59,312
- Slight: 351,436

#### 3. Causalities by Vehicle type
- Cars: 333,485 (majority)
- Bikes & Vans: 33k each
- Buses: 12,798
- Tricycles & Others: Minor share

#### By Road Type:
- Single carriage roads: Over 300k
- Dual carriage: Over 80k
- Roundabouts: Over 40k

#### 4. By Road Surface:
- Most on dry roads, fewer on wet, least on snow/ice

#### 5. By Light Condition:
- 73% during daylight, 27% in the dark

#### 6. In rural & urban areas
- 61% in urban areas, 39% in rural areas

## Key Insights
- Human behavior is a major factor: With most accidents happening in daylight and on dry roads, poor weather isn’t the main issue. This suggests driver distraction, speeding, or carelessness play a big role.

- Cars dominate accident statistics: With over 333,000 casualties involving cars, targeted policies for private vehicle users—like stricter driver training, awareness programs, and speed monitoring—could make a big difference.

- Single carriage roads are high-risk zones: Over 70% of casualties occurred on single-lane roads, pointing to design limitations, poor traffic flow, or lack of safety features like barriers or clear markings.

- Nighttime accidents, though fewer, may be more severe: The 27% that occur in the dark might involve higher speeds or visibility issues, requiring better lighting and reflective signage.

- Road design and traffic management need attention: High numbers at roundabouts and dual roads suggest that infrastructure isn’t always guiding safe behavior, even in supposedly safer setups.

## Recommendations
- Improve Driver Behavior
Launch public awareness campaigns and enforce stricter penalties for reckless driving, especially during daytime when most accidents occur.

- Focus on High-Risk Roads
Prioritize safety upgrades on single carriage roads—add road markings, barriers, and speed control measures.

- Target Car Users
Implement stricter driving tests, promote use of in-car safety features, and introduce regular vehicle safety checks for private car owners.

- Enhance Night Visibility
Invest in better street lighting, reflective road signs, and encourage use of high-visibility gear for night drivers and riders.

- Use Data to Guide Action
Regularly analyze accident data to identify trends and quickly respond with targeted safety measures in problem areas.

## Conclusion
This analysis shows that road accidents remain a serious issue, with most casualties involving cars and happening on single carriage roads, during daylight, and on dry surfaces. This suggests that many accidents are linked to driver behavior, not just road or weather conditions. By focusing on improving road safety where it matters most—like high-risk roads and car users—and encouraging safer driving habits, we can help reduce the number of accidents and save more lives.
